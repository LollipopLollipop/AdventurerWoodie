Progress Log for AdventureWoodie starting from Mar 14:

Mar 14:
redesign project architecture 
redeisgn game play scene (background, ocean wave, etc)
task design for different levels
detailize key game logic ideas 
1: score calculation for different levels
2: goals for different levels
3: conditions for game over
4: how the hero fights enemies 

Mar 18:
implement addObstacle (enemy spawning mechanism) functions to add sharks to waves randomly 
add restart button everytime game over(still has bugs)
problems still exist:
1: object collisions are not properly detected
2: waves are not properly looped
TO DO: more detailed checking with moving the _physicsNode 

Mar 23:
re-examine FlappyBird projects hope to find why AdventureWoodie fails (both projects have moving physicsNode)
fix bugs for moving physicsNode while the hero moves forward
fix problems at Mar 18: 1,2
TO DO: 
1: add level mechanisms
2: add enemy killing mechanisms
problems still exist:
1: restart button does not work
2: why the hero crashes with waves even after setting it "not affected by gravity" and add no y-direction velocity?
3: placeWood method does not place wood at accurate position 
4: why placed woods keep disappearing before moving to the edge of the screen?
5: sharks stop appearing after first couple of minutes
6: how to create custom particle effects?
refine game logic ideas 


Mar 27:
implement the dragWood method
fix the collision problems between different objects 
fix problems at Mar 23: 2,3,4,5
problems still exist:
1: space conversion 
2: how to change readyWood?
3: CCPhysicsSpringJoint add failure 

April 1:
fix problems at Mar 27: 1, 2, 3
implement enemy killing method and animation 
TODO: 
1: add level mechanism
2: variable renaming (make them consistent)
