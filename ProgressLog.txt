Progress Log for AdventureWoodie starting from Mar 14:

Mar 14:
DONE:
redesign project architecture 
redeisgn game play scene (background, ocean wave, etc)
task design for different levels
detailize key game logic ideas 
1: score calculation for different levels
2: goals for different levels
3: conditions for game over
4: how the hero fights enemies 

Mar 18:
DONE:
implement addObstacle (enemy spawning mechanism) functions to add sharks to waves randomly 
add restart button everytime game over(still has bugs)
problems still exist:
1: object collisions are not properly detected
2: waves are not properly looped
TO DO: 
more detailed checking with moving the _physicsNode 

Mar 23:
DONE:
re-examine FlappyBird projects hope to find why AdventureWoodie fails (both projects have moving physicsNode)
fix bugs for moving physicsNode while the hero moves forward
fix problems at Mar 18: 1,2
TO DO: 
1: add level mechanisms
2: add enemy killing mechanisms
3: fix problems still exist:
	1: restart button does not work
	2: why the hero crashes with waves even after setting it "not affected by gravity" and add no y-direction velocity?
	3: placeWood method does not place wood at accurate position 
	4: why placed woods keep disappearing before moving to the edge of the screen?
	5: sharks stop appearing after first couple of minutes
	6: how to create custom particle effects?
4: refine game logic ideas 


Mar 27:
DONE:
implement the dragWood method
fix the collision problems between different objects 
fix problems at Mar 23: 2,3,4,5
problems still exist:
1: space conversion 
2: how to change readyWood?
3: CCPhysicsSpringJoint add failure 

April 1:
DONE:
fix problems at Mar 27: 1, 2, 3
implement enemy killing method and animation 
TODO: 
1: add level mechanism
2: variable renaming (make them consistent)



Apr5:
DONE: 
add level mechanism (gamescene change for every level)
trnasform game mechanics and levels in OO methodology
variable, methods renaming to fit OO framework (easy reading?debugging)
TODO:
1: modify score calc method
2: revise restart method
3: enhance precision of wood placed
4: what happens if shark collide with woods already there 
5: double check prev wood update
6: why hero would fall even on top of wood
7: fix problems with wood falling
